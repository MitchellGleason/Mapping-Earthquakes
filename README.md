# Mapping Earthquakes
 
# Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To accomplish this, we will be using the Leaflet.js API to plot earthquake data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
